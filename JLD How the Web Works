1. HTTP is HyperText Transfer Protocol and it governs how clients get data from, or send data to, a server.


2. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, a URL is an address for some internet resource.


3. DNS stands for Domain Name System. DNS is a system that takes human-readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.


4. A query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL


5. Two HTTP Verbs and their use cases would be: 
     GET - get some data from the server (most pages, search forms)
     POST - send some data to the server (pages that change data on server)


6. An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol!

    An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol (eg sending back HTML/CSS/JS/etc)


7. An HTTP header provide additional information about the request or the response. Some examples include: 
    Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
    Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control

8. When you type a URL in a browser, your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS, it also makes a request to that IP address, including headers, It makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed like images, it also separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each, and the server sends a response, typically, HTML, with a status code! It will send a 200 if successful.
